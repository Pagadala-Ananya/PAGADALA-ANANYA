## Hi there My Name is PAGADALA ANANYAðŸ‘‹

##ABOUT ME

 I am a final year Computer Science and Engineering student at SR University with solid background in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. An internship at NIT Warangal has helped me gain experience in graph theory, NLP and optimization algorithms, which I have acquired through my academic journey. I have developed meaningful projects such as medical record summarization with T5 and bird audio detection with CNNs and so on, which shows that I can use deep learning to solve practical problems.

I can also program in Python, C, and SQL, or can use tools such as TensorFlow, Pandas, or Google Colab. I have as well received certification in AWS Machine Learning and Microsoft Azure Fundamentals. I am ardent about the use of AI to provide scalable innovative solutions.
